# Pulling an Image

When pulling an image from a registry, the client MUST know the following information beforehand:
- The hostname of the registry.
- The name of the image's repository.
- A tag name or digest that specifies a specific version of the image.

## Step 1: Fetch the manifest

## Step 2: Fetch blobs referenced in the manifest.
